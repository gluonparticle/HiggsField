I hope this e-mail finds you well. I am Sargun Singh, and I am writing to express my interest in collaborating with [Organization Name] for the Google Summer of Code programme. I am really excited about the opportunity to make a contribution to the sector of open-source Quantum Chemistry by way of working on the mission: "Computational Framework for Simulating and Visualizing Complex Molecular Structures"


I actually have a sturdy passion for computational chemistry and visualization, and I believe that my preceding enjoy aligns well with the dreams of this mission. Two years in the past, I evolved a project targeted on simulating 4f orbitals in three-D the usage of chance density, especially concentrated on the Cerium atom. This mission concerned imposing algorithms to calculate orbital possibilities, visualizing the effects in 3D space, and studying the traits of the orbitals. I actually have additionally shared this project on my GitHub repository, along side certain documentation and snap shots showcasing the simulations.

Through this mission, I gained valuable revel in in manipulating molecular statistics, utilizing numerical strategies for visualisation, and understanding the intricacies of atomic orbitals. I am confident that I can leverage this revel in to contribute efficiently to the improvement of the proposed venture for GSoC.

In addition to my technical abilties, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic learner who's keen to collaborate with mentors and fellow contributors to attain mission objectives. I am devoted to producing wonderful code, adhering to excellent practices, and actively collaborating inside the open-supply network.

I am enthusiastic about the possibility to work with [Organization Name] and contribute to advancing the sector of computational chemistry. I am assured that my capabilities and enjoy make me a appropriate candidate for this project, and I am eager to speak about how I can make contributions in addition.

Thank you for thinking about my software. I sit up for the opportunity of running together in this thrilling assignment.

Warm regards,
